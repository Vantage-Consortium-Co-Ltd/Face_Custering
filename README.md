# Face_Custering

Face image clustering implemented from scratch with NumPy (hard K-means). The images are grouped into one output folder per cluster.

## How it works

1. `get_data` reads every `.jpg` in the dataset folder as grayscale, resizes it to `IMG_SIZE` (default 240x300) and flattens it into one vector per image. It returns the vectors together with the file names, in the same order.
2. `Custering.kmeans_calculate` runs K-means on those vectors (mean squared distance, random initial centroids), prints the centroid change on every iteration until it converges, and returns the cluster index of each image.
3. `Custering.group_custering` reads each original image from the dataset folder with OpenCV and writes it to `Output/cluster_<n>/`, where `<n>` is the cluster index of that image.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | Entry point: load data, run K-means, print `Name: <file>, Cluster: <n>` and copy the images into `Output/` |
| `data.py` | `get_data` (load and preprocess images, returns `data_x, file_names`) |
| `operation.py` | `Custering` class: `kmeans_calculate` (K-means) and `group_custering` (write images into cluster folders) |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |

## Dataset layout

Put the face images directly inside `Dataset/`, next to `main.py`. Only `.jpg` files are read, and subfolders are not scanned.

```
Dataset/
├── example.jpg
├── example_2.jpg
└── example_3.jpg
```

The file name is what gets printed next to the cluster number, so name each file after the person or image you want to recognize in the output, for example `example.jpg`. The `Dataset/` and `Output/` folders are git-ignored and are not included in the repository.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

Example output:

```
Data shape: (18, 72000)
...
Change: 0.0
Hard Mean Clustering Results:
Name: example.jpg, Cluster: 0
Name: example_2.jpg, Cluster: 2
...
```

The images are then written to `Output/cluster_0/`, `Output/cluster_1/` and so on.

Change the number of clusters with `k` in `main.py`, the output folder with the last argument of `group_custering`, and the image size with `IMG_SIZE` in `data.py`.

## Notes

- All images are resized to the same size, otherwise the flattened vectors have different lengths and `np.array` fails.
- K-means starts from random centroids, so cluster numbers (and sometimes the grouping) can differ between runs.
- An empty cluster keeps its previous centroid.
- Images in `Output/` are re-encoded by OpenCV (`imread` then `imwrite`), so they are saved in color but are not byte-identical copies of the originals.
- `Output/` is not cleared between runs, so images from earlier runs stay in their old cluster folders. Delete it before re-running.
- Raw pixels mostly capture lighting and background rather than identity, so clusters may not match people.
- `.heif` and other non-`.jpg` files in `Dataset/` are skipped.
